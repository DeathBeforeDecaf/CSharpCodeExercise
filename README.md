# CSharpCodeExercise

Here is a rough sketch for my solution of the CSharp coding exercise.  The test system is functional, but testing is always an NP-complete process which is never done. :^}

Since testing isn't complete I've stubbed in a first pass of the test cases and have set their Assertions to fail - just like I would at the start of any other project.  Along the way I have made assumptions and have tried to document them in context.

If you have any questions please let me know!
